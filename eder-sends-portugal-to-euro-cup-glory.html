                <div class="col-md-12">
<p>Portugal finally lifted the Euro Cup, thanks to their golden boy <b>Eder</b></>, who 
scored a brilliant goal, 11 minutes from the end of extra-time to give Portugal a 1-0 win and their first major tournament trophy.
Twelve years after their heartbreak against Greece, they have beaten the hosts 1-0 in the final.
This was the greatest moment in Portugal's football history which the likes of Eusebio, Figo, Rui Costa would have liked to achieve.
In the past Portugal have had teams with far more attacking intent and flair, and they could n't achieve a major trophy. 
and this team will forever be the first Portugal side to win a major tournament.
</p>
<p class="seconward">
Earlier in the match, Griezmann had a chance to score in the 10 th minute.
Payet floated a gorgeous diagonal ball into the box and <b>Griezmann</b>'s header was looping into the top left corner, 
only for Goal keeper Rui Patricio to pushes it over. Portugal captain <b>Cristiano</b> Ronaldo was limped off the match in the 25th minute, 
eighteen minutes after injuring his knee in a clash with Dimitri Payet.
Ronaldo’s injury was heartbreaking to watch, but it turns out to be a blessing in disguise for Portugal.
Portugal knew they can no more depend on their talisman and in his absence, the likes of Joao Mario were forced to abandon their 
conservative shape and be more adventurous, going forward. 
Goalkeeper <b>Rui Patricio</b> had a heroic performance and defenders Pepe and Jose Fonte was outstanding through out the match, 
they frustrated France, growing in threat and strength as a largely tedious match ran on.<span class="blockquote1">Eder scores the winner in the 109th minute...<img 
    src="/images/news/68476/68476_eder.jpg" width="480" height="270"/></span>
It was a performance in keeping with their tournament so far: pretty unspectacular, going to extra-time, getting the job done. 
But as much as Fernando Santos deserves praise for the resilience he has installed in this team, France, and Didier Deshcamps, can only be condemned. 
France never stepped up to the occasion. They were strangely devoid of ideas, 
and looked dangerous only when Moussa Sissoko went on a driving run or the rare moments when Antoine Griezmann got free in the box, 
one arching header being tipped over by the superb Rui Patricio and another flashing over the bar.
</p>

<p  class="seconward">
 Eder was brought on as a substitute in the 79th minute of the match after Portugal coach Santos decided he needed a more physical presence in attack.
This decision gave Portugal a lot more impetus going forward. With Nani and Quaresma also dropping back to help defensively, 
France found it difficult to break them down in midfield. But as soon as Portugal regained possession, 
they had three options – spread it to Nani, spread it to Quaresma or launch it to Eder. 
Portugal's first shot on target in this match has come in the 80th minute.<span class="blockquote2">Gignac nearly wins it for France, but his shot hits the near post !<img 
    src="/images/news/68476/68476_gignac.jpg"  width="480" height="270"/></span>
France almost won it at the end of normal time when substitute Andre-Pierre Gignac turned and hit the inside of the post.
During the extra time Raphael Guerreiro hit the bar with a free-kick for Portugal after 108 minutes, 
but seconds later they were ahead when Eder fired a low, 25-yard drive past keeper Hugo Lloris, 
that made sure Eder will be forever remembered in Portugese Footballing history. 
</p>

<p  class="seconward">
 It was fitting that Eder scored the winner for Portugal as he was jeered by some Portugese fans during a game in March. 
Eder, born in Guinea-Bissau, decided to play football for his adopted country Portugal.
Born Ederzito Antonio Macedo Lopes, his parents in Guinea-Bissau gave him up as a child because they couldn't afford to raise him.
He moved to Portugal and was raised in foster care where his talent for football was discovered. 
He made his international debut against Azerbaijan in 2014 but since then has only been a fringe player.
Even his presence in Portugal's 23-man Euro 2016 squad was in doubt until the very last minute, 
and his goal against France was only his fourth in 29 international appearances.


<i>"I understood that Eder was the player who had to come on to hold up the ball in attack and create problems for France in the air"</i>, <b>Santos</b> said.
<i>"When he came on, he said he would score the goal, and he did.
He deserves congratulations. The ugly duckling turned into a beautiful one."</i> </p>
